# codefresh_permission (Resource)

```hcl
resource "codefresh_team" "developers" {
  name = "developers"

  users = [
      "5efc3cb6355c6647041b6e49",
      "59009221c102763beda7cf04"
    ]
}

resource "codefresh_permission" "developers" {

  team = codefresh_team.developers.id
  resource = "pipeline"
  action = "run"
  tags = [
      "demo",
