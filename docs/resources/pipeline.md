# codefresh_pipeline (Resource)

The central component of the Codefresh Platform. Pipelines are workflows that contain individual steps. Each step is responsible for a specific action in the process.

See the [documentation](https://codefresh.io/docs/docs/configure-ci-cd-pipeline/introduction-to-codefresh-pipelines/) for the details.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "codefresh_project" "test" {
  name = "myproject"
}

resource "codefresh_pipeline" "test" {

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [
      revision
    ]
  }

  name    = "${codefresh_project.test.name}/react-sample-app"

  tags = [
    "production",
    "docker",
  ]

  spec {
    concurrency         = 1
    branch_concurrency  = 1
    trigger_concurrency = 1

    priority    = 5

    spec_template {
      repo        = "codefresh-contrib/react-sample-app"
      path        = "./codefresh.yml"
      revision    = "master"
      context     = "git"
    }

    contexts = [
      "context1-name",
      "context2-name",
    ]

    trigger {
      branch_regex  = "/.*/gi"
      context       = "git"
      description   = "Trigger for commits"
      disabled      = false
      events        = [
        "push.heads"
      ]
      modified_files_glob = ""
      name                = "commits"
      provider            = "github"
      repo                = "codefresh-contrib/react-sample-app"
      type                = "git"
    }

    trigger {
      branch_regex  = "/.*/gi"
      context       = "git"
      description   = "Trigger for tags"
      disabled      = false
      events        = [
        "push.tags"
      ]
      modified_files_glob = ""
      commit_status_title = "tags-trigger"
      name                = "tags"
      provider            = "github"
      repo                = "codefresh-contrib/react-sample-app"
      type                = "git"
    }

    variables = {
      MY_PIP_VAR      = "value"
      ANOTHER_PIP_VAR = "another_value"
    }
  }
}
```
